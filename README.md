# vcs_final_project

You can find my webpage here: http://codingschoolprojektai.lt/tmp/kgbootcamp/ieva_rimaite/wp/

The website is built on WordPress platform and it has responsive web design.

# Programming languages used: 
- HTML5 to build structure.
- CSS3 to give some style. I used a little bit of Sass as well to add color variables and for nesting media queries.
- JavaScript - jQuery was used to develop collection webpage filter.
- PHP for WordPress.
